# 00-myScript


All script I use



Hello guys!

This script creates the tree structure you need to start a web project. It contains a public and a src folder, inside the public one you can find a "assets" "js" "style" folder and the src folder contains a sass folder (I'm working with sass atm)

Have fun with it ;)
